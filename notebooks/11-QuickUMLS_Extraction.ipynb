    "### Data: A full QuickUMLS resource of the UMLS is not provided here as this would violate license agreements.  However, below are some resources on how to generate such resources.  In this medspacy repo is a small sample of UMLS (RRF files) which contains less than 100 concepts which can be found here:\n",
    "https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/new_users/online_learning/Meta_006.html\n",
    "### Usage: The cells below show how to use the QuickUMLS component on its own or in combination with other medspacy components out of the box such as `medspacy.context` for detecting semantic modifiers and attributes of entities, including negation, uncertainty and others.\n",
    "### NOTE: There are two major result \"modes\" for using QuickUMLS.  The default is to use entities in spacy documents.  The limitation of this is that matches cannot overlap.  The other \"mode\" is to use (SpanGroups)[https://spacy.io/api/spangroup] which were introduced in spacy 3.  These spans can overlap and several users have requested such functionality since UMLS has many concepts which may overlap which you may want to process after the QuickUMLS component.  This difference will be demonstrated below.\n",
    "### Generating QuickUMLS resources: Given RRF UMLS files, you can generate your own QuickUMLS resources with parameters such as language, character case and more.  To see more, consult the documentation here from the original QuickUMLS repo:\n",
